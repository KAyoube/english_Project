      <h5>Joaquim Silva - Cybersecurity Manager</h5>
      <p>Cybersecurity management can be described as everything an organisation does to protect AI from 
        cyber attacks, intrusions, malware and various types of data breaches. 
        All businesses and public bodies are vulnerable to cyber attacks, which are increasing in sophistication and number. 
        The proper functioning of networks and the protection of sensitive data require constant monitoring and proper cybersecurity management.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="infoAyoube" class="infos" style="display:none;">
      <h5>Ayoube - Data Analyst</h5>
      <p>If Data Analyst's job is also to exploit and interpret data, the Data Scientist has a global vision.
        He's responsible for translating business problems into mathematical and statistical problems, 
        to provide reports to guide AI decision-making and improve their performance.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="infoThomas" class="infos" style="display:none;">
      <h5>Thomas Niaux - AI Enginner</h5>
      <p>The AI engineer can create programs to teach the machine to react in place of man on subjects where the data is numerous and reliable enough to be organised. 
        It's just as important to analyse the data, 
        human behaviour and business processes as it's to organise them into a coherent system that can be transmitted to the machine. 
        This is what is known as 'machine learning'. 
        Deep learning" is concerned with more complex and comprehensive processes, based on what are known as "neural networks".
        The quadruple training of the EPITA IA institute allows to approach complexity with a real scientific,   
        technical, managerial and human training, because the AI Engineer, in all his actions, must keep the measure of man and the sense of ethics.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="infoJeff" class="infos" style="display:none;">
      <h5>Jefferson - Coffee Manager</h5>
      <p>As a cloud architect, his role is to make AI evolve to meet the needs of the business. 
        To do this, they must first identify these needs and collect the relevant data. 
        He must then conceive the solution to be deployed, define its design and put it in place. 
        In addition, his mission also involves ensuring that the solution or architecture adopted corresponds to the existing environment.</p>

      <h4>Future project: Human 2.0</h4>
      <div id="projectTextContainer">
        <p>An internal exoskeleton allows a human to lift more than 100 times his weight (average human weight).</p>
        <p>Aquatic breathing</li>
        <p>The ability to talk to each other at a distance and without external telephone support.</p>
        <p>Accelerated motor skills, humans will be able, like AIs, to move at speeds of over 150km/h (or even break the sound barrier, depending on the means of protection deployed).</p>
        <p>The ability to locate oneself spatially thanks to an integrated "gps", thanks to the coded eye currently being developed, which will be able to create a map in the image of the eye of everything that surrounds it (study of nanotechnologies underway).</p>
        <p>Everything the eye sees will be recorded as it is in the part reserved for this purpose, and thanks to the names of the streets and a satellite view of the city, it will be able to have a 2D and 3D map.</p>
